# Emmy’s Portfolio

This project is my second homework assignment for the Code Bootcamp. I needed to upgrade my original portfolio website and make it responsive. This project is helpful because having a responsive website is important so that it is funcitonal on different types of screens and different screen sizes. I was able to see what I am capable of and how I was able to overcome challenges to make sure it would work on a computer and a phone. 


### Installing

You need the internet and a browser to be able to view the pages and a code application such as Visual Studio Code to view the code or you can inspect it in the dev tools available in the browser.

### Screenshot

Screenshots from the About Me & Portfolio page showing responsiveness.
